# Chess Game

A work-in-progress chess game that I am developing to explore game logic, project structure, and clean code design.  
The project is being built step by step, with features added incrementally.

---

## Current Features
- Chess board representation
- Initial piece movement logic
- Turn-based gameplay foundations

---

## Roadmap
- Complete movement rules for all pieces
- Implement special rules (castling, en passant, pawn promotion)
- Detect check, checkmate, and stalemate
- Add a simple user interface
- Explore AI opponent functionality
